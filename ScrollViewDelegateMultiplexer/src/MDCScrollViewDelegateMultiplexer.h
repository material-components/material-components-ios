/**
 * MDCScrollViewDelegateMultiplexer acts as a proxy object for UIScrollViewDelegate events and
 * forwards all received events to an ordered list of registered observers.
 *
 * When a UIScrollViewDelegate method invocation is received by the multiplexer, the multiplexer
 * forwards the invocation to each observer in order of registration.
 *
 * If the scroll view method signature has a return value, after all delegate method invocations,
 * the return value will be provided by the first observing delegate that responded. If no
 * observers implement the method, a default return value will be used.
 *
 * However, if a combiner is set and the receiving class conforms to the
 * MDCScrollViewDelegateCombining protocol, then the receiving class can designate which result
 * value to return via the use of the optional protocol methods.
 *
 * Example implementation:
 *
 *     _multiplexer = [[MDCScrollViewDelegateMultiplexer alloc] init];
 *     myScrollView.delegate = _multiplexer;
 *     [_multiplexer addObservingDelegate:myControl];
 *     [_multiplexer addObservingDelegate:anotherControl];
