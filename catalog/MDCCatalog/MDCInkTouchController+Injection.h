@interface MDCInkTouchController (ManyInkViews)

/**
 Enumerates the given view's subviews for an instance of MDCInkView and returns it if found, or
 creates and adds a new instance of MDCInkView if not.

 This method is a convenience method for adding ink to an arbitrary view without needing to subclass
 the target view. Use this method in situations where you expect there to be many distinct ink views
 in existence for a single ink touch controller. Example scenarios include:

 - Adding ink to individual collection view/table view cells

 This method can be used in your MDCInkTouchController delegate's
 -inkTouchController:inkViewAtTouchLocation; implementation.
