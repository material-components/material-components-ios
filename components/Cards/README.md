Cards contain content and actions about a single subject. They can be used standalone, or as part
of a list. Cards are meant to be interactive, and aren't meant to be be used solely for style
purposes.

## Overview

Cards provides two different versions, `MDCCard` inheriting from `UIControl` and `MDCCardCollectionCell` inheriting from `UICollectionViewCell`.

A card's state determines its visual styling.

When treated as a `UIControl` (`MDCCard`), it has a default styling (`UIControlStateNormal`), and a highlighted styling (`UIControlStateHighlighted`) when interacted with.

When treated as a `UICollectionViewCell` (`MDCCardCollectionCell`), it has a default styling (`MDCCardCellStateNormal`), a highlighted styling (`MDCCardCellStateHighlighted`), and lastly a selected styling (`MDCCardCellStateSelected`).

Customization to the card is exposed via its API either in `MDCCard` or `MDCCardCollectionCell`. Currently the card consists of these customizations:

- The border width for a specific state
- The border color for a specific state
- The shadow elevation for a specific state
- The shadow color for a specific state
- The corner radius for the card

(`MDCCardCollectionCell` customization only):

- Changing the image that appears in the Selected state.
- Changing the image tint color that appears in the Selected state.

An `MDCCard` can be added and used as you would add any `UIView` or `UIControl`, if manually in code, or through Interface Builder.

An `MDCCardCollectionCell` can be added, used, and reused as a `UICollectionViewCell`, if manually in code, or through Interface Builder.

MDCCardThemer exposes apis to theme MDCCard and MDCCardCollectionCell instances as either a default or outlined variant. An outlined variant behaves identically to a default styled card, but differs in its coloring and in that it has a stroked border. Use 'applyScheme:toCard:' to style an instance with default values and 'applyOutlinedVariantWithScheme:toCard:' to style an instance with the outlined values.

### Cards Classes

#### MDCCard

`MDCCard` subclasses `UIControl` and provides a simple class for developers to subclass and create custom cards with ink, shadows, corner radius, and stroke matching the Material spec.

`MDCCard` uses the `highlighted` property that is built-in in `UIControl` and the `UIControlState` to move between states.

#### MDCCardCollectionCell

`MDCCardCollectionCell` subclasses `UICollectionViewCell` and provides a simple collection view cell for developers to use in their collections with ink, shadows, corner radius, and stroke matching the Material spec.

`MDCCardCollectionCell` uses the `selected` property that is built-in in `UICollectionViewCell` and has its own `MDCCardCellState` to keep track of the current state it is in.

## Installation

<!-- Extracted from docs/../../../docs/component-installation.md -->

### Installation with CocoaPods

Add the following to your `Podfile`:

```bash
pod 'MaterialComponents/Cards'
```
<!--{: .code-renderer.code-renderer--install }-->

Then, run the following command:

```bash
pod install
```

import MaterialComponents.MaterialCards
```

#### Objective-C

```objc
#import "MaterialCards.h"
```
<!--</div>-->


## Usage

<!-- Extracted from docs/typical-use-view.md -->

### Typical use: as a view

`MDCCard` can be used like a regular UIView.

<!--<div class="material-code-render" markdown="1">-->
#### Swift

```swift
let card = MDCCard()

// Create, position, and add content views:
let imageView = UIImageView()
card.addSubview(imageView)
```

#### Objective-C

```objc
MDCCard *card = [[MDCCard alloc] init];

// Create, position, and add content views:
UIImageView *imageView = [[UIImageView alloc] init];
[card addSubview:imageView];
```
<!--</div>-->

<!-- Extracted from docs/typical-use-collections.md -->

### Typical use: in a collection view

Use `MDCCardCollectionCell` as a base class for your custom collection view cell

<!--<div class="material-code-render" markdown="1">-->
#### Swift

```swift
collectionView.register(MDCCardCollectionCell.self, forCellWithReuseIdentifier: "Cell")

func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView,
                    cellForItemAt indexPath: IndexPath) -> UICollectionViewCell {
  let cell = collectionView.dequeueReusableCell(withReuseIdentifier: "Cell",
                                                for: indexPath) as! MDCCardCollectionCell
  // If you wanted to have the card show the selected state when tapped
  // then you need to turn isSelectable to true, otherwise the default is false.
  cell.isSelectable = true
  
  cell.selectedImageTintColor = .blue
  cell.cornerRadius = 8
  cell.setShadowElevation(6, for: .selected)
  cell.setShadowColor(UIColor.black, for: .highlighted)
  return cell
}
```

#### Objective-C

```objc
[self.collectionView registerClass:[MDCCardCollectionCell class]
        forCellWithReuseIdentifier:@"Cell"];

- (UICollectionViewCell *)collectionView:(UICollectionView *)collectionView
                  cellForItemAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath {
  MDCCardCollectionCell *cell =
  [collectionView dequeueReusableCellWithReuseIdentifier:@"Cell"
                                            forIndexPath:indexPath];
  // If you wanted to have the card show the selected state when tapped
  // then you need to turn selectable to true, otherwise the default is false.
  [cell setSelectable:YES];
  
  [cell setSelectedImageTintColor:[UIColor blueColor]];
  [cell setCornerRadius:8.f];
  [cell setShadowElevation:6.f forState:MDCCardCellStateSelected];
  [cell setShadowColor:[UIColor blackColor] forState:MDCCardCellStateHighlighted];
}
```
<!--</div>-->


## Extensions

<!-- Extracted from docs/color-theming.md -->

### Color Theming

You can theme a card with your app's color scheme using the ColorThemer extension.

You must first add the Color Themer extension to your project:

```bash
pod 'MaterialComponents/Cards+ColorThemer'
```

<!--<div class="material-code-render" markdown="1">-->
#### Swift
```swift
// Step 1: Import the ColorThemer extension
import MaterialComponents.MaterialCards_ColorThemer

// Step 2: Create or get a color scheme
let colorScheme = MDCSemanticColorScheme()

// Step 3: Apply the color scheme to your component
MDCCardsColorThemer.applySemanticColorScheme(colorScheme, to: component)
```

#### Objective-C

```objc
// Step 1: Import the ColorThemer extension
#import "MaterialCards+ColorThemer.h"

// Step 2: Create or get a color scheme
id<MDCColorScheming> colorScheme = [[MDCSemanticColorScheme alloc] init];

// Step 3: Apply the color scheme to your component
[MDCCardsColorThemer applySemanticColorScheme:colorScheme
     toCard:component];
```
<!--</div>-->


## Accessibility

<!-- Extracted from docs/accessibility.md -->

### Card Accessibility

To help ensure your cards are accessible to as many users as possible, please be sure to review the following 
recommendations:

#### Accessibility for Cards in a Collection

Since assistive technologies visit all cards in a collection in a sequential order, it is often 
easier to distinguish between elements that belong to different cards by aggregating all the 
card's information so the card is read as a single sentence.  
This can be done by setting an appropriate 
[`accessibilityLabel`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiaccessibilityelement/1619577-accessibilitylabel) 
for the card. Additionally, set the card's 
[`isAccessibilityElement`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/nsobject/1615141-isaccessibilityelement) 
to true. Cards are a container element and setting isAccessibiltyElement for a container 
turns off individually selecting its subelements.

Swift
```swift
  card.isAccessibilityElement = true
  card.accessibilityLabel = "Location \(userLocation.name) is popular with users " +
    "who enjoy \(userLocation.popularActivityMatchingUserProfile(userProfile))"
```

Objective-C
```objc
  card.isAccessibilityElement = YES;
  card.accessibilityLabel = [NSString 
    stringWithFormat:@"Location %@ is popular with users who enjoy %@",  
    userLocation.name, 
    userLocation.popularActivityMatchingUserProfile(userProfile)];
```

#### Accessibility for Single Cards

Nested elements in MDCCards are available to assistive technologies without additional 
customization, however additional setup may be needed to accommodate special scenarios, 
such as:

#### Accessibility for Single Cards: Images 
Images that have additional context beyond text that is already presented on the card.  
For example, news article images can benefit from an 
[`accessibilityLabel`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiaccessibilityelement/1619577-accessibilitylabel) 
describing their content.

Swift
```swift
  articleImageView.isAccessibilityElement = true
  articleImageView.accessibilityLabel = "Event or scene description"
```

Objective-C
```objc
  articleImageView.isAccessibilityElement = YES;
  articleImageView.accessibilityLabel = @"Event or scene description";
```

#### Accessibility for Single Cards: Star Rating
Star or rating images should have an 
[`accessibilityLabel`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiaccessibilityelement/1619577-accessibilitylabel) 
describing its purpuse and an 
[`accessibilityValue`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiaccessibilityelement/1619583-accessibilityvalue) 
describing the rating value.

Swift
```swift
  ratingView.isAccessibilityElement = true
  ratingView.accessibilityLabel = "Average customer rating, out of " + 
    "\(MDCProductRating.maximumValue) stars"
  ratingView.accessibilityValue = (String)product.averageRating
```

Objective-C
```objc
  ratingView.isAccessibilityElement = YES;
  ratingView.accessibilityLabel = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"Average customer" +
    " rating, out of %d stars", MDCProductRating.maximumValue];
  ratingView.accessibilityValue = @(product.averageRating).stringValue;
```

#### Accessibility for Single Cards: Reordering elements
Primary content or actions that appear lower on the screen will be read last by assistive 
technologies, sometimes after longer or non-primary content. To change the order, or group 
elements together, you can make the card an accessibility container by adopting the 
[`UIAccessibilityContainer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/accessibility/uiaccessibilitycontainer) 
protocol. Grouping and order is controlled by creating as many 
[`UIAccessibilityElement`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiaccessibilityelement) 
elements as needed, and returning them in the desired order.
