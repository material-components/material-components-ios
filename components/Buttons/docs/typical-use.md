### Typical use

`MDCButton` is designed to be a drop-in replacement for UIButton, but with more options for
customizing the button's style and behavior.

<!--<div class="material-code-render" markdown="1">-->
#### Swift
```swift
let button = MDCButton()
```

#### Objective-C

```objc
MDCButton *button = [[MDCButton alloc] init];
```
<!--</div>-->

See the
