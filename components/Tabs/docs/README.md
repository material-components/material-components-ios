## Overview

When a user taps a tab, the content changes to match the selected subject in the tabs.

We provide this functionality through MDCTabBar which communicates via a delegate as well as
MDCTabBarViewController which provides a view containment model similar to UITabViewController.

Tabs can also show a badge (usually a number) like UITabBar.
