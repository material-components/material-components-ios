## Overview

`MDCBannerView` is a view that displays important, succinct message, and provides actions for users to address (or dismiss the banner). It requires a user action to be dismissed.

`MDCBannerView` is currently a [beta component](../../../contributing/beta_components.md). Therefore, clients that
wish to use MDCBannerView in their app will need to manually specify the MaterialComponentsBeta target and our repository.
