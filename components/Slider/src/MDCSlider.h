/**
 A material slider.

 @see https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/sliders.html for full details.

 Differences between UISlider and MDCSlider:
   Does not have api to
     set right and left icons
     set the thumb image
     set the right and left track images (if you wanted a custom track)
     set the right (background track) color
   Same features
     set color for thumb via @c thumbColor
     set color of track via @c trackColor
   New features
     making the slider a snap to discrete values via @c numberOfDiscreteValues.
