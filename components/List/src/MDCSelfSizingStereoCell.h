/**
 MDCSelfSizingStereoCell is intended to be an easy to use readymade implementation of a basic
 "Stereo" cell. A stereo cell can be thought of as a roughly symmetrical cell with image views on
 either side--like the speakers in an old fashioned boombox stereo.

 The client is expected to configure the exposed subviews in any way they like from within
 `-collectionView:cellForItemAtIndexPath:`. At the end of that method, the client should set the
 cellWidth property so the cell has the information it needs to calculate the frames of its subviews
 and its height.

 The client is expected NOT to manually set the frames of the view themselves or manipulate the
 view hierarchy in any way.
