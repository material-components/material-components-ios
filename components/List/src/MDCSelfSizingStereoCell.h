/**
 MDCSelfSizingStereoCell is intended to be an easy to use readymade implementation of a basic
 "Stereo" cell. A stereo cell can be thought of as a roughly symmetrical cell with image views on
 either side--like the speakers in an old fashioned boombox stereo.

 The cell is intended to be used with a UICollectionViewFlowLayout with an estimatedItemSize.
 Setting estimatedItemSize on the layout tells the collection view and the layout to query the cell
 for a size that best fits the estimated size. The cell lays out its contents according to the width
 provided in the estimated size and then calculates a height based off the layout. For any given
 width there is only one correct height.

 The client is expected to configure the exposed subviews in any way they like from within
 `-collectionView:cellForItemAtIndexPath:`. If changes that might have ramifications to the cell's
 layout or size are made outside of `-collectionView:cellForItemAtIndexPath:` a call to
 `-setNeedsLayout` is necessary to invalidate previously calculated layouts.

 The client is expected NOT to manually set the frames of the view themselves or manipulate the view
 hierarchy in any way.
