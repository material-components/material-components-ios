This class acts as a proxy object for UIScrollViewDelegate events and forwards all received
events to an ordered list of registered observers.

#import "MaterialScrollViewDelegateMultiplexer.h"

myScrollView.delegate = _multiplexer;
[_multiplexer addObservingDelegate:myControl];
[_multiplexer addObservingDelegate:anotherControl];
```
