/**
 MDCBottomSheetTransitionController is be used to setup a custom transition and animationed
 presentation and dismissal for material-styled bottom-sheet presentation.

 This class provides a basic implementation of UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning and
 UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate.

 In order to use a custom modal transition, the UIViewController to be presented must set two
 properties. The UIViewControllers transitioningDelegate should be set to an instance of this class.
 myDialogViewController.modalPresentationStyle = UIModalPresentationCustom;
 myDialogViewController.transitioningDelegate = bottomSheetTransitionController;

 The presenting UIViewController then calls presentViewController:animated:completion:
 [rootViewController presentViewController:myDialogViewController animated:YES completion:...];
