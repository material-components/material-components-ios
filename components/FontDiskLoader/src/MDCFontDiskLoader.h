/**
 This class loads and registers a custom font by file url.

 This class provides a convenience layer on top of CoreText APIs. Registration occurs by @c fileURL,
 therefore registration state is shared across all instances of MDCFontDiskLoader objects. For
 example if two MDCFontDiskLoader objects have the same fileURL, calling @c load one will also
 alter the state of the second MDCFontDiskLoader object. The same holds true for @c unload.
 This class is thread safe and can be called from any thread.
