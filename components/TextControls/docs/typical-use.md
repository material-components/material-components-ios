### TextFields

The largest difference between MDCTextControl textfields and UITextFields from a usability standpoint relates to the sizing behavior of MDCTextControl textfields, and the implications of that sizing behavior for layout. Where UITextField can be whatever height a user wants it to be, MDCTextControl textfields have heights that they need to be in order to look correct. The process for ensuring that MDCTextControl textfields have their preferred heights depends on whether one is in an Auto Layout or Manual Layout environment. In an Auto Layout environment, the textfield's preferred height will be reflected in `intrinsicContentSize`, and the user will not have to do anything other than set a width constraint on the textfield to ensure that the preferred height is achieved. In a Manual Layout environment, standard methods like `sizeThatFits:` or `sizeToFit` must be used to inform the frames of the textfield. These methods assume that the textfield already has the preferred width.
