### Text fields

The largest difference between MDCTextControl text fields and UITextFields from a usability standpoint relates to the sizing behavior of MDCTextControl text fields. Where UITextField can be whatever height a user wants it to be, MDCTextControl text fields have heights that they need to be in order to look correct. The process for ensuring that MDCTextControl text fields have their preferred heights depends on whether one is in an Auto Layout or Manual Layout environment. In an Auto Layout environment, the text field's preferred height will be reflected in `intrinsicContentSize`, and the user will not have to do anything other than set a width constraint on the text field to ensure that the preferred height is achieved. In a Manual Layout environment, standard methods like `sizeThatFits:` or `sizeToFit` must be used to inform the frames of the text field. These methods assume that the text field already has the preferred width.
