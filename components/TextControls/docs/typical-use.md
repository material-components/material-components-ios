### TextFields

Using TextControl textfields is supposed to be as similar to using UITextField as possible. The most crucial difference from a usability standpoint relates to the sizing behavior of these textfields and the implications of that behavior for layout. Where UITextField can be whatever height a user wants it to be, MDCTextControl textfields have heights that they need to be in order to look correct. There is a precise vertical arrangement of the various subviews in MDCTextControl textfields, and this arrangement affects how tall the view ends up being. Other things like font also help determine the height. Ensuring that MDCTextControl textfields have their desired heights is done differently depending on whether one is working in an Auto Layout or a Manual Layout environment. In an Auto Layout environment, the textfield's desired height will be reflected in `intrinsicContentSize`, and the user will not have to do anything to ensure that the correct height is achieved. In a Manual Layout environment, methods like `sizeThatFits:` or `sizeToFit` must be used to inform the frames of the view.
