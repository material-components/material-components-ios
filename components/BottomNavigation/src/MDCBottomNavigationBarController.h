/**
 MDCBottomNavigationBarController is a class that manages the navigation bar that allows movement
 between primary destination in an app.  It ties a list of view controllers to the bottom
 navigation bar and will display the corresponding view controller in the content view when an
 in the navigation bar is selected.

 State Restoration:
 To enable state restoration assign a unique restoration identifier to any children view
 controllers that can be restored and implement the children's methods
 @c encodeWithRestorableStateWithCoder: and @c decodeRestorableStateWithCoder if needed. At
 startup set the @c viewControllers property. UIKit will restore the contents of each child view
 controller with encoded values corresponding with the child's restoration identifier. If a child
 view controller's restoration identifier is not set, its state will not be restored on the next
 application launch.
 A reference to the selected view controller is encoded when the state of this view controller is
 preserved. Upon decoding, if the view controllers array contains a reference to the previous
 selected view controller, that view controller is set to selected.
