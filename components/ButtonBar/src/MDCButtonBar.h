#pragma mark Button Items

/**
 An array of UIBarButtonItem objects that will be used to populate the button views in this bar.

 Setting a new array of items will result in immediate recreation of the button views.

 Once set, changes made to the UIBarButtonItem properties will be observed and applied to the
 created button views.

 ### Item target/action method signature

 The complete action method signature is:

 - (void)didTap:(UIBarButtonItem *)item event:(UIEvent *)event button:(UIButton *)button;

 Each argument can be optionally-specified. E.g. @selector(didTap) is an acceptable action.

 ### iPad popover support

 MDCButtonBar is not able to associate UIBarButtonItem instances with their corresponding UIButton
 instance, so certain UIKit methods that accept a UIBarButtonItem cannot be used. This includes,
 but may not be limited to:

 - UIPopoverController::presentPopoverFromBarButtonItem:permittedArrowDirections:animated:
 - UIPrinterPickerController::presentFromBarButtonItem:animated:completionHandler:
 - UIPrintInteractionController::presentFromBarButtonItem:animated:completionHandler:
 - UIDocumentInteractionController::presentOptionsMenuFromBarButtonItem:animated:
 - UIDocumentInteractionController::presentOpenInMenuFromBarButtonItem:animated:

 Instead, you must use the related -FromRect: variant which requires a CGRect and view. You can
 use the provided UIButton by implementing the complete action method signature:

 - (void)didTap:(UIBarButtonItem *)item event:(UIEvent *)event button:(UIButton *)button;

 The MDCButtonBarDelegate protocol defines the means by which MDCButtonBar can request that a

 An object that conforms to this protocol must forward UIControlEventTouchUpInside events to the

 argument to the item's target/action invocation. This method signature is made available by
 importing the MDCAppBarButtonBarBuilder.h header. The MDCAppBarButtonBarBuilder.h header should
 *only* be
 imported in files that implement objects conforming to MDCButtonBarDelegate.
