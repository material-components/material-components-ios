/**
 The MDCButtonBar class provides a view comprised of a horizontal list of buttons.

 This view will register KVO listeners on the provided button items for the following properties:

 - enabled
 - title
 - image

 If any of the above properties change, the MDCButtonBar will immediately reflect the change
 in the visible UIButton instance.
 */
@interface MDCButtonBar : UIView

#pragma mark Button Items

/**
 The UIBarButtonItem objects that will be used to populate the button views in this bar.

 Setting a new array of button items will immediately recreate all visible buttons by
 calling @c reloadButtonsViews.

 Once set, the receiver will watch changes to the UIBarButtonItem properties and apply
 them to the created button views.

 ### Item target/action method signature

 The complete action method signature is:

 - (void)didTap:(UIBarButtonItem *)item event:(UIEvent *)event button:(UIButton *)button;

 Each argument can be optionally-specified. E.g. @selector(didTap) is an acceptable action.

 ### iPad popover support

 MDCButtonBar is not able to associate UIBarButtonItem instances with their corresponding UIButton
 instance, so certain UIKit methods that accept a UIBarButtonItem cannot be used. This includes,
 but may not be limited to:

 - UIPopoverController::presentPopoverFromBarButtonItem:permittedArrowDirections:animated:
 - UIPrinterPickerController::presentFromBarButtonItem:animated:completionHandler:
 - UIPrintInteractionController::presentFromBarButtonItem:animated:completionHandler:
 - UIDocumentInteractionController::presentOptionsMenuFromBarButtonItem:animated:
 - UIDocumentInteractionController::presentOpenInMenuFromBarButtonItem:animated:

 Instead, you must use the related -FromRect: variant which requires a CGRect and view. You can
 use the provided UIButton by implementing the complete action method signature:

 - (void)didTap:(UIBarButtonItem *)item event:(UIEvent *)event button:(UIButton *)button;

 The MDCButtonBarDelegate protocol defines the means by which MDCButtonBar can request that a

 An object that conforms to this protocol must forward UIControlEventTouchUpInside events to the
 button bar's didTapButton:event: method signature in order to pass the correct UIBarButtonItem
 argument to the item's target/action invocation. This method signature is made available by
 importing the MDCButtonBar+Builder.h header. The MDCButtonBar+Builder.h header should *only* be
 imported in files that implement objects conforming to MDCButtonBarDelegate.
