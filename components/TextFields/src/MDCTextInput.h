/**
 The Material Design guidelines have many suggestions for handling text input. The inputs that
 conform to this protocol have all the API necessary to achieve those suggestions.

 They are, however, dumb; they do not handle error state nor validation.

 - For handling error states and other Material behaviors use an MDCTextInputController on your
 inputs.
 - For validation, there are many 3rd party libraries you can use like:
   - https://github.com/3lvis/Validation
   - https://github.com/adamwaite/Validator
