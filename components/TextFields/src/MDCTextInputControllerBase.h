/**
 Base class providing floating placeholder animation and other functionality.

 NOTE: This class is intended to be subclassed. It contains the logic for 'automagic' error states.

 The placeholder text is laid out inline. If floating is enabled, it will float above the field when
 there is content or the field is being edited. The character count is below text. The Material
 Design guidelines call this 'Floating inline labels.'
