/**
 Material Design compliant text field 'box' from 2017. The logic for 'automagic' error states
 changes:
 underline color, underline text color.
 https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/text-fields.html#text-fields-single-line-text-field

 The placeholder text is laid out inline. If floating is enabled, it will float above the field when
 there is content or the field is being edited. The character count is below text. The Material
 Design guidelines call this 'Floating inline labels.'
 https://material.io/guidelines/components/text-fields.html#text-fields-labels

 The background is filled, the corners are rounded, there's no border, there is an underline, and
 the placeholder is centered vertically in the filled area.
