 This method is usually called from whatever object is the UITextFieldDelegate for the MDCTextField.
 That object is responsible for validation of the text and calling this method if the error state
 needs to change.

 When errorText != nil, the text input is in an error state:
 - The error text appears in the underline text with the errorColor as text color.
 - The input rectangle's underline, placeholder and character are colored to the errorColor.

 When errorText == nil, the text input is not in error state:
 - The underline text is restored to the color and value it was.
 - The underline color and height is restored.
 - The placeholder text is restored to the color it was.
 - The character count text is restored to the color it was.

 Setting errorText to an empty string (@"") will put the input in error state but the underline text
 will be empty. It will color (if visible) the underline, the placeholder, and the character
 count in the errorColor.

 Setting errorAccessibilityValue when errorText == nil has no effect.

 Note: The characterCountMax property also affects these same MDCTextInput properties.
