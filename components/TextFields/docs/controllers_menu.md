##  Controllers menu

MDC's text fields are designed to be styled by controllers implementing the `MDCTextInputController` protocol. The following controllers are included in the text field component and each one is highly customizeable to express your app's branding and styling.

Some of the classes are marked as "Preferred". These are known, thru extensive UX research, to have big performance gains in usability.

Another two of the classes are "Legacy". They are included to support older designs and avoid breaking changes that come from the new layout and size of new styles.
