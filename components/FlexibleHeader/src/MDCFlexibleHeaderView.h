 When this is enabled, the flexible header will assume that minimumHeight and maximumHeight both
 include the Safe Area top inset. For example, a header whose maximum content height should be 200
 might set 220 (200 + 20) as the maximumHeight. Notice that if this is enabled and you're setting
 minimumHeight and or maximumHeight, the flexible header won't automatically adjust its size to
 account for changes to the Safe Area, as the values provided already include a hardcoded inset.

 When this is disabled, the flexible header will assume that the provided minimumHeight and
 maximumHeight do not include the Safe Area top inset. For example, a header whose maximum content
 height should be 200 would set 200 as the maximumHeight, and the flexible header will take care
 of adjusting itself to account for Safe Area changes internally.

 Clients are recommended to set this to NO, and set the min and max heights to values that don't
 include the status bar or Safe Area insets.

 @warning This API will soon be disabled by default and then deprecated. Learn more at

#pragma mark Scroll View Tracking

/**
 The scroll view whose content offset affects the height/offset of the flexible header view.

 The receiver will inject the maximum height of the header view into the top component of the
 tracking scroll view's content insets. This ensures that there is enough space in the top insets
 to fit the header. This should be taken into account when working with the tracking scroll view's
 content insets.

 Importantly, if you wish to make changes to the tracking scroll view's content insets after it
 has been registered to a flexible header view, you must do so from within a -changeContentInsets:
 invocation on the flexible header view.

 The tracking scroll view is weakly held so that we don't unintentionally keep the scroll view
 around any longer than it needs to be. Doing so could get into tricky situations where the view
 controller didn't nil out the scroll view's delegate in dealloc and UIScrollView's non-weak
 delegate points to a dead object.

 Whether to automatically observe the trackingScrollView's content offset changes.

 When enabled, the header view will observe the contentOffset property of the tracking scroll view
 and react to changes accordingly.

 You must not forward any scroll view events to the header view if this property is enabled. Any
 attempts to do so will result in an assertion.

 If you attempt to enable this property when shiftBehavior is set to anything other than
 MDCFlexibleHeaderShiftBehaviorDisabled, an assertion will be thrown. If you intend to use any
 shifting behavior you must manually forward the necessary scroll view events.

 @note If you enable this property and you support iOS 10.3 or below, you are responsible for
 explicitly nilling out the tracking scroll view before it is deallocated. This is not required if
 your minimum OS is iOS 11 or above. Failure to nil out the tracking scroll view may lead to runtime
 crashes due to dangling observers on the tracking scroll view. Most commonly, the tracking scroll
 view can be nil'd out in the view controller's dealloc method. An example of the error you might
 see is: "An instance of class UITableView was deallocated while key value observers were still
 registered with it."
