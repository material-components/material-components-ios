### Dynamic Type

#### Overview

Users configure text styles on fonts, such as caption and overline, included in a typography scheme. Then, these scalable fonts can be used for [Dynamic Type](../../../Typography) for components. Some default versions of MDCTypographyScheme include scalable fonts. The inline documentation indicates whether a default version of MDCTypographyScheme consists of scalable fonts or not.

#### useCurrentContentSizeCategoryWhenApplied

`useCurrentContentSizeCategoryWhenApplied` is a property on MDCTypographyScheme. This property only has an effect if the fonts stored on the typography scheme are scalable. It indicates whether the scalable font on the scheme should be adjusted with respect to the current content size category when it is applied on a component.
