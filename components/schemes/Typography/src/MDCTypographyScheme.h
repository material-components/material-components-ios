 A hint for how fonts in this scheme should be applied to components in relation to Dynamic Type.

 @note Enabling this flag only has an effect if the fonts stored on this scheme are scalable. See
 MDCTypographySchemeDefaults for default versions that are scalable. Alternatively, you can specify
 custom scalable fonts using the MDCFontScaler API.

 When fonts are applied to components:

 - If this flag is disabled, make no changes to the font.
 - If this flag is enabled, adjust the font with respect to the current content size category.

 Default value is NO.
