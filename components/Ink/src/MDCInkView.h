/**
 A UIView that draws and animates the Material Design ink effect for touch interactions.

 There are two kinds of ink:

 Bounded ink: Ink that spreads from a point and is contained in the bounds of a UI element such as a
 button. The ink is visually clipped to the bounds of the UI element. Bounded ink is the most
 commonly-used ink in the system. Examples include basic Material buttons, list menu items, and tile
 grids.

 Unbounded ink: Ink that spreads out from a point "on top" of other UI elements. It typically
 reaches a maximum circle radius and then fades, unclipped by other UI elements. Typically used
 when interacting with small UI elements such as navigation bar icons or slider "thumb" controls.
 Examples include overflow menus, icon toggle buttons, and phone dialer keys.

 Note that the two kinds of ink are designed to have different animation parameters, that is,
 bounded ink isn't just clipped unbounded ink. Whether the ink is bounded or not depends on the kind
 of UI element the user is interacting with.
