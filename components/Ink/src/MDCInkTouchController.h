 MDCInkTouchController associates a MDCInkView with a UIGestureRecognizer to control the spread of
 the ink.

 MDCInkTouchControllerDelegate.

 The controller does not keep a strong reference to the view to which it is attaching an ink view.
 It is expected that the view will keep a strong reference to its own ink controller, or that the
 view controller controlling the view will keep a strong reference to that view's ink controller.
