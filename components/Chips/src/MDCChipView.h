 A Material chip.

 @see https://material.io/go/design-chips for full details.

 Chips are compact elements that represent an attribute, text, entity, or action.

 Chips contain an optional leading image, a title label and an optional trailing accessory view.
 They can also contain a leading image that appears only when the chip is selected.

 Chips currently support two contentHorizontalAlignment styles: centered
 (UIControlContentHorizontalAlignmentCenter) and default
 (any other UIControlContentHorizontalAlignment value). In the default mode, the image and text will
 be left-aligned, and the accessory view will be right aligned. In the centered mode, all three will
 appear together in the center of the chip.

 A UIImageView that leads the title label. Appears in front of the imageView. Only visible when the
 chip is selected.

 This image view is typically used to show some icon that denotes the chip as selected, such as a
 check mark. If imageView has no image then the chip will require resizing when selected or
 deselected to account for the changing visibility of selectedImageView.
