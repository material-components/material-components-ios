 MDCActionSheetController displays an alert message to the user, similar to

 A Material Action Sheet consists of a title, message and a list of actions.

 The [Material Guidelines article for Bottom
 Sheets](https://material.io/design/components/sheets-bottom.html) and the
 [Material Guidelines article for Lists](https://material.io/design/components/lists.html) have more
 detailed guidance about how to style and use Action Sheets.

 [UIAlertController](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uialertcontroller)
 or
 [UIAlertControllerStyleActionSheet](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uialertcontrollerstyle/uialertcontrollerstyleactionsheet)

 MDCActionSheetController does not support UIPopoverController, instead it will always be presented
 in a sheet from the bottom.
