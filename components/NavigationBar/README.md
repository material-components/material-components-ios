# Navigation Bar

The Navigation Bar component is a view composed of a left and right Button Bar and either a title
label or a custom title view.

Consistent with iOS design guidelines, the title in the navigation bar is centered by default. However, certain use cases may warrant use of a left aligned title such as: when there is a strong relationship between the title and additional content appearing in the navigation bar, or where centering the title causes ambiguity.

## Overview

Navigation Bar is a drop-in replacement for UINavigationBar with a few notable exceptions:

- No navigationItem stack. Instances of MDCNavigationBar must be explicitly provided with a back
  button. TODO(featherless): Explain how to create a back button with Navigation Bar once
  https://github.com/material-components/material-components-ios/issues/340 lands.

The MDCNavigationBar class is a composition of two [Button Bars](../ButtonBar) and a title label or
title view. The left and right Button Bars are provided with the navigation item's corresponding bar
button items.

Read the Button Bar section on
[UIBarButtonItem properties](../ButtonBar/#uibarbuttonitem-properties) to learn more about supported
UIBarButtonItem properties.

## Usage

### Importing

Before using Navigation Bar, you'll need to import it:

<!--<div class="material-code-render" markdown="1">-->
#### Swift
``` swift
import MaterialComponents.MaterialNavigationBar
```

#### Objective-C

``` objc
#import "MaterialNavigationBar.h"
```
<!--</div>-->

### Observing UINavigationItem instances

MDCNavigationBar can observe changes made to a navigation item property much like how a
UINavigationBar does. This feature is the recommended way to populate the navigation bar's
properties because it allows your view controllers to continue using `navigationItem` as expected,
with a few exceptions outlined below.

> If you intend to use UINavigationItem observation it is recommended that you do not directly set
> the navigation bar properties outlined in `MDCUINavigationItemObservables`. Instead, treat the
> observed `navigationItem` object as the single source of truth for your navigationBar's state.

#### Starting observation

To begin observing a UINavigationItem instance you must call `observeNavigationItem:`.

<!--<div class="material-code-render" markdown="1">-->
#### Swift
``` swift
navigationBar.observe(navigationItem)
```

#### Objective-C
``` objc
[navigationBar observeNavigationItem:self.navigationItem];
```
<!--</div>-->

#### Stopping observation

<!--<div class="material-code-render" markdown="1">-->
#### Swift
``` swift
navigationBar.unobserveNavigationItem()
```

#### Objective-C
``` objc
[navigationBar unobserveNavigationItem];
```
<!--</div>-->

#### Exceptions

All of the typical properties including UIViewController's `title` property will affect the
Navigation Bar as you'd expect, with the following exceptions:

- None of the `animated:` method varients are supported because they do not implement KVO events.
  Use of these methods will result in the Navigation Bar becoming out of sync with the
  navigationItem properties.
- `prompt` is not presently supported. https://github.com/material-components/material-components-ios/issues/230.
