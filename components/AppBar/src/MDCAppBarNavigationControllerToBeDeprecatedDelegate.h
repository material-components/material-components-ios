/**
 Informs the receiver that the given App Bar will be added as a child of the given view controller.

 This event is primarily intended to allow any configuration or theming of the App Bar to occur
 before it becomes part of the view controller hierarchy.

 By the time this event has fired, the navigation controller will already have attempted to infer
 the tracking scroll view from the provided view controller.

 @note This method will only be invoked if a new App Bar instance is about to be added to the view
 controller. If a flexible header is already present in the view controller, this method will not
 be invoked.

 @warning This method will soon be deprecated. Please use
 -appBarNavigationController:willAddAppBarViewController:asChildOfViewController: instead. Learn
