/**
 The MDCAppBarParenting protocol defines a set of properties that store the necessary objects
 for working with a Material App Bar.

 A Material App Bar consists of a flexible view with a shadow, a navigation bar, and space for
 flexible content such as a photo.

 TODO(featherless): This implementation currently only consists of the flexible view. Add the
 navigation bar APIs in the future as those APIs are formalized.

 Learn more at the [Material spec](https://www.google.com/design/spec/patterns/scrolling-techniques.html)

 This protocol must be implemented by a UIViewController class.

 A view controller must conform to this protocol in order to use
 MDCAppBarInitializePropertiesOfParent and MDCAppBarAddViews. The combination of these APIs is
 commonly referred to as "injection". This contrasts with the alternative "wrapping" API,
 MDCAppBarContainerViewController.
