### UINavigationItem support

The App Bar begins mirroring the state of your view controller's `navigationItem` in the provided
`navigationBar` once you call `addSubviewsToParent`.

Learn more by reading the Navigation Bar section on
[Observing UINavigationItem instances](../../NavigationBar/#observing-uinavigationitem-instances).
Notably: read the section on "Exceptions" to understand which UINavigationItem are **not**
supported.
