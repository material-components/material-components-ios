### Tracking a scroll view

The App Bar's flexible nature is made possible due to the Flexible Header's ability to respond to
interactions with a scroll view. Learn how to set up this scroll view tracking by reading the
Flexible Header section on [Tracking a scroll view](../../FlexibleHeader/#tracking-a-scroll-view).
