# Trigger Kokoro runs on PRs coming from upstream changes.
#
# Copied from https://github.com/google/iree/blob/master/.github/workflows/kokoro_labeler.yml
#
# This is achieved by labeling them with "kokoro:run".
#
# For security, Kokoro does not run automatically on all PRs (since that
# would grant RCE), but it does run automatically on PRs from collaborators
# and Google organization members. Unfortunately, GitHub apps appear to be
# impossible to register as either.
#
# The labeler action requires a GITHUB_TOKEN with write access to the
# repository. PRs from forks run within the fork and only receive a token
# with read access (for security reasons). Thus the label step would fail.
# The entire job is conditioned on the PR author being the copybara app, so
# it simply shouldn't run on these other PRs.
