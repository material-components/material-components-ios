# Pesto

An Example app demonstrating the use of Material Components for iOS

## Installation/Building

Pesto uses [cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/) for dependency
management. You will need cocoapods as well as SSH access to
[material-components-ios](https://github.com/google/material-components-ios).
Needing SSH access is only temporary until MDC launches publicly.

To install/build, cd into this directory and run `pod install`.
Then run `open Pesto.xcworkspace`.  Do **not** open `Pesto.xcodeproj`
or the project will not build.
