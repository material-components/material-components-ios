# ZShadow

An Example app demonstrating the interaction of UIView shadows

## Installation/Building

ZShadow uses [cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/) for dependency
management. You will need CocoaPods as well as access to
[material-components-ios](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-ios).

To install/build, cd into this directory and run `pod install`.
Then run `open ZShadow.xcworkspace`. Do **not** open `ZShadow.xcodeproj`
or the project will not build.
