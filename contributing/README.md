# General Contributing Guidelines

The Material Components contributing policies and procedures can be found in the main Material Components documentation repository’s [contributing page](https://github.com/material-components/material-components/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## iOS-specific Additions

The iOS team also abides by the following policy items:

### Code Conventions

MDC follows certain [coding styles and conventions](code-conventions.md) for its code to help
everyone easily read, review, and understand our code. Please follow these conventions when
submitting pull requests.

### Component Checklist

All components should pass [these](checklist.md) checks or give a compelling reason why they shouldn’t.

There is a [great script](../scripts/check_components) that checks for _some_ of these criteria. Run it regularly during development. It will also be run by the continuous integration system when you make a pull request. If the script fails at that point, the pull request will be blocked.

### Issue and Pull Request Titles

Start the title with `[ComponentName]` to identify which component a change affects. Use
`[ComponentName|OtherComponentName]` for commits affecting multiple components, which should be rare.

```
[FooBar] Removes the deprecated fooWithBar:(Bar*)bar method.
```

#### Using assignee to indicate who should action on a PR

Since PRs on github permanently stay in the `Changes requested` state it is hard to tell when the author has addressed the concerns. By change the assignee to whomever still needs to action (review or modify/justify) we can more easily keep track of what needs attention in our PR queues.

1. For a reviewer this means adding the author as an assignee once the review is finished.
1. For an author it means adding back the reviewer (and removing themselves) as an assignee.


### Deprecation

See [deprecation_policy.md](deprecation_policy.md) for details.

### Hotfixing

Occasionally it is necessary to hotfix the framework. See [hotfixing.md](hotfixing.md) for details.

## Finding an issue to work on

MDC-iOS uses GitHub to file and track issues.
To find an issue to work on, filter the issues list by the ["is:Help wanted" label](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-ios/labels/is%3AHelp%20wanted).

## The small print

Contributions made by corporations are covered by a different agreement than the one above, the [Software Grant and Corporate Contributor License Agreement](https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-corporate).
