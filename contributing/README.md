## Found an Issue?

If you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by
[submitting an issue](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-ios/issues) to our GitHub
repository. Even better: send a fix as a [pull request](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-ios/compare/)!

- - -

## Feature Request?

You can request a new feature by [submitting an
issue](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-ios/issues) to our GitHub repository. If you
would like to implement a new feature then consider what kind of change it is:

- Major changes that you wish to contribute to the project should be discussed first on our [dev
  mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/material-components-ios-discuss) so that we
  can better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work, and help you to craft the change
  so that it is successfully accepted into the project.
- Small changes can be crafted and submitted to the GitHub Repository as a [pull request]
(https://github.com/material-components/material-components-ios/compare/).

- - -

## Submitting an Issue

Before you submit your issue [search the
archive](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-ios/issues) in case your question has
already been answered. If your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new
issue. Help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new features, by not
reporting duplicate issues. Providing the following information will increase the chances of your
issue being dealt with quickly:

- Overview of the issue - if an error is being thrown a stack trace helps
- Motivation and context - explain why this is a bug for you
- Version number - this will help us identify where fixes should be made
- Operating system and hardware - which version of iOS and the hardware being run on
- Reproduction steps - was it just a one time error or can you show the steps to reproduce?
- Related issues - has a similar issue been reported before?

Here is a great example of a [well defined issue](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/5069)
in angular.js.

## Signing the CLA

Please sign our Contributor License Agreement (CLA) before sending pull requests. For any code
changes to be accepted, the CLA must be signed. It's a quick process, we promise!

- For individuals we have a [simple click-through form]
(http://code.google.com/legal/individual-cla-v1.0.html).
- For corporations we'll need you to sign a different [agreement]
(http://code.google.com/legal/corporate-cla-v1.0.html).

## Pull requests

For major changes, it's worthwhile discussing the idea on our [mailing
list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/material-components-ios-discuss)—that way you'll get
early feedback on your idea and find out if the approach has been tried before or if someone else
is working on it. [Search our GitHub](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-ios/issues)
issues to see if anyone has proposed the idea before, too. Feature requests and bug fixes should be
tracked with issues, so file one early on and assign it to yourself once you have started it.

### Conventions

MDC follows certain [coding styles and conventions](code-conventions.md) for its code to help
everyone easily read, review, and understand our code. Please follow these conventions when
submitting pull requests.

### Tips for a good pull request

Pull requests can be hard to review if they try to tackle too many things
at once. Phabricator's
"[Writing Reviewable Code](https://secure.phabricator.com/book/phabflavor/article/writing_reviewable_code/)"
provides a set of guidelines that help increase the likelihood of your
pull request getting merged.

In short (slightly modified from the original article):

- A pull request should be as small as possible, but no smaller.
- The smallest a pull request can be is a single cohesive idea: don't
  make pull requests so small that they are meaningless on their own.
- Turn large pull requests into small pull requests by dividing large
  problems into smaller problems and solving the small problems one at
  a time.
- Write sensible pull request descriptions.

Our additions:

- A pull request should affect as few components as possible.
- Pull requests must include a modification to the CHANGELOG.md summarizing the
  change.

### Before you contribute

Before we can use your code, you must sign the
[Google Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual?csw=1)
(CLA), which you can do online. The CLA is necessary mainly because you own the
copyright to your changes, even after your contribution becomes part of our
codebase, so we need your permission to use and distribute your code. We also
need to be sure of various other things—for instance that you'll tell us if you
know that your code infringes on other people's patents. You don't have to sign
the CLA until after you've submitted your code for review and a member has
approved it, but you must do it before we can put your code into our codebase.
Before you start working on a larger contribution, you should get in touch with
us first through the issue tracker with your idea so that we can help out and
possibly guide you. Coordinating up front makes it much easier to avoid
frustration later on.

### Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
allow pull requests to be filed, but we perform code reviews on codereview.cc.

### The small print

Contributions made by corporations are covered by a different agreement than
the one above, the
[Software Grant and Corporate Contributor License Agreement](https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-corporate).

### Submitting a [Pull Request](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-ios/compare/)

Once you have code that is ready to share, please create a [pull request](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-ios/compare/) against our [GitHub
repo](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-ios). See [GitHub's documentation about pull
requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) for more information.

### Subject Format
We use a simple format for titles:

- Start the title with `[ComponentName]` to identify which component a change affects. Use
  `[ComponentName|OtherComponentName]` for commits affecting multiple components, which should be
rare.
- Use `[ComponentName]!` to indicate that a change introduce a breakage: removing/renaming an
  element of the public API.
- Use `[ComponentName]?` to indicate that a change (deliberately) introduces warnings. For example
  when we mark an API deprecated.

A good example of a title is:

~~~ objective-c
[FooBar]! Removes the deprecated fooWithBar:(Bar*)bar method.
~~~

When referencing GitHub issues, use the full URL:
`https://github.com/material-components/material-components-ios/issues/nnn` instead of the shorthand `#nnn`.

Pull requests will be reviewed in [Phabricator's Differential code review
tool](http://codereview.cc) instead of directly in GitHub. When you submit your pull request, a bot
will reply with a link to the code review discussion. If you haven't done so before, create a new
account on Phabricator and join the discussion of your changes.

# Component checklist

This checklist describes the process by which Material components are built.

## API review

API reviews work like typical code reviews with the added constraint of only reviewing the
component's **public APIs**.

To initiate an API review, send a pull request that only includes the public APIs you wish to
review.

TODO(featherless): Flesh this out with some concrete examples of existing API reviews.
