# Writing component README.md files

This guide provides the essential recommendations for writing component README.md files.

## Template README.md

This is the basic template for a component's README.md. Parts that you, the writer, are expected to
fill out have been marked with `TODO` statements.


    # TODO: ComponentName

    TODO: Single sentence description of the component.

    ## Design & API Documentation

    <ul class="icon-list">
      <li class="icon-list-item icon-list-item--spec">
        <a href="https://material.io/guidelines/<TODO: link to spec>">
          TODO: link to spec
        </a>
      </li>
      <li class="icon-list-item icon-list-item--link">
        <a href="/components/<ComponentName>/apidocs/Classes/<TODO: API name>.html">
          TODO: API name
        </a>
      </li>
    </ul>

    ## Overview

    TODO *Optional section*. Provide a high level overview of the component here. This is a good
    place to provide:

    - comparisons with related UIKit APIs, and
    - explanations of the overall component structure.

    ## Usage

    TODO **Required section**. Provide essential integration steps here.

    Remember that the audience for this section is someone completely new to using Material
    components; don't assume or expect the reader to have read another component's README. At best
    you can assume that the reader read the Quick Start guide.

    ### Additional information section

    TODO **Recommended section**. These breakout sections are a perfect opportunity to talk about
    edge case behaviors.

## Code snippets

Every code snippet must provide both an Objective-C version and a Swift version. Consult the
document on [Supported Versions](supported_versions.md) for information on which version of the
Swift language to use when writing examples.

    #### Objective-C
    ``` objc
    - (void)viewDidLoad {
      [super viewDidLoad];

      ...

      // After all other views have been registered.
      MDCAppBarAddViews(self);
    }
    ```

    #### Swift
    ``` swift
    override func viewDidLoad() {
      super.viewDidLoad()

      // After all other views have been registered.
