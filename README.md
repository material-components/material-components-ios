### What can you use instead?

We recommend that you follow Apple's Human Interface Guidelines and consider
using modern UIKit components or SwiftUI instead. Both offer a high degree of
flexibility through which you can express your product's brand while providing a
predictable and familiar Apple platforms experience for your users. You'll also
benefit from ongoing investments Apple makes in accessibility, ease of use, and
deep integrations with OS features.

Alternatively, [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/widgets/material)
enables you to get a Material look and feel across all platforms.

### What maintenance mode means for MDC iOS

Once we enter maintenance mode we will have the following support policy:

- Releases will be cut on a best-effort and as-needed basis.
- Feature and support requests will automatically be closed.
- Bugs will be addressed on a best-effort basis.
- All iOS-specific documentation on material.io will be removed.
- We will no longer maintain any `.md` documentation on GitHub.
- Contributions may still be accepted, but reviews will be performed on a best-effort basis and are not guaranteed to result in a merge.
