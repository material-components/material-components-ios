## Feature Request

Please request new features by
[submitting an issue](https://github.com/google/material-components-ios/issues) to our GitHub
repository.

If you would like to implement a new feature then consider what kind of change it is:

- Major changes that you wish to contribute to the project should be discussed first on our
  [dev mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/material-components-ios-discuss) so
  that we can better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work, and help you craft a
  change that will be successfully accepted into the project.
- Small changes can be sent as a
  [pull request](https://github.com/google/material-components-ios/pull/new).

## Submitting an Issue


Before submitting an issue,
[search the archive](https://github.com/google/material-components-ios/issues). It's possible that
your question was already asked and/or answered.

If your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, please open a new issue. Help us to
maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new features by not reporting duplicate
issues. Providing the following information will increase the chances of your issue being dealt with
quickly:

- Overview of the issue - if an error is being thrown a stack trace helps
- Motivation and context - explain why this is a bug for you
- Version number - this will help us identify where fixes should be made
- Operating system and hardware - which version of iOS and the hardware being run on
- Reproduction steps - was it just a one time error or can you show the steps to reproduce?
- Related issues - has a similar issue been reported before?

Here is a great example of a well defined issue:

## Submitting a Pull Request

TODO(featherless): CLA instructions or other requirements before getting to this step.

For major changes, it's worthwhile discussing the idea on our
[mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/material-components-ios-discuss).
This will provide you with early feedback on your idea and help find out if the approach has been
tried before or if someone else is working on it.

[Search our GitHub](https://github.com/google/material-components-ios/issues) issues to see if
anyone has proposed the idea before, too.

Once you have code that is ready to share, please create a pull request against our
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/google/material-components-ios/pull/new). See
[GitHub's documentation about pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)
for more information.

Pull requests will be reviewed by the Core Team in a code review tool called Phabricator hosted
at [codereview.cc](http://codereview.cc) instead of directly in GitHub. When you submit your pull
request, a bot will reply with a link to the code review discussion. You will be able to view the
full discussion on [codereview.cc](http://codereview.cc). In order to leave comments, please log
in to codereview.cc with your GitHub account.

We recommend running clang format on your changes before sending a pull request.
