## Submitting an Issue

Before you submit your issue [search the archive](https://github.com/google/material-components-ios/issues) in case your question has already been answered. If your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue. Help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new features, by not reporting duplicate issues. Providing the following information will increase the chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

- Overview of the issue - if an error is being thrown a stack trace helps
- Motivation and context - explain why this is a bug for you
- Version number - this will help us identify where fixes should be made
- Operating system and hardware - which version of iOS and the hardware being run on
- Reproduction steps - was it just a one time error or can you show the steps to reproduce?
- Related issues - has a similar issue been reported before?

Here is a great example of a well defined issue: [https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/5069](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/5069)

## Submitting a Pull Request
For major changes, it's worthwhile discussing the idea on our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/material-components-ios-discuss)—that way you'll get early feedback on your idea and find out if the approach has been tried before or if someone else is working on it. [Search our GitHub](https://github.com/google/material-components-ios/issues) issues to see if anyone has proposed the idea before, too. Feature requests and bug fixes should be tracked with issues, so file one early on and assign it to yourself.

Once you have code that is ready to share, please create a pull request against our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/google/material-components-ios). See [GitHub's documentation about pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) for more information.

Pull requests will be reviewed in [Phabricator's Differential code review tool](http://codereview.cc) instead of directly in GitHub. When you submit your pull request, a bot will reply with a link to the code review discussion. If you haven't done so before, create a new account on Phabricator and join the discussion of your changes.
